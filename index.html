       <h2>The Simpsons</h2>   
       <p>Our differences are only <em>skin deep</em>, but our sames go down to the bone. And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of <strong>Krusty</strong> merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</p>
       <p>And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of <strong>Krusty</strong> merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. <strong> For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.</strong> <em> Uh, no, you got the wrong number.</em> This is <strong>9-1...2.</strong></p>
       <p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname?We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! <strong>Stay out of my booze.</strong></p>
       <p>And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. <strong>Duffman</strong> can't breathe! OH NO! Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is <strong>9-1...2.</strong></p>
       <ol>
            <li>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV!</li>
            <li>Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/">Nobel Prize</a> for attempted chemistry?</li>
            <li>What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.</li>
       </ol>  
       <h2>Star Wars</h2>
       <p>You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Look, I can take you as far as <strong>Anchorhead</strong>. You can get a transport there to <strong>Eisley</strong> or wherever you're going. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
       <ul>
            <li>I need your help, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker">Luke</a> She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</li>
            <li>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like...suicide.</li>
            <li><strong>Red Five</strong> standing by.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><strong>Red Five</strong> standing by. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, <strong>Princess</strong>. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Ye-ha! You don't believe in the Force, do you?</p>
       <p>No! <strong>Alderaan</strong> is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly... But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. <em>There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.</em> It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>
